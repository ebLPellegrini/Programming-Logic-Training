This code is getting RunTime Error in Beecrowd. However, it runs normally in locally. 

### Annotations ###
- Instead of doing every step at once (as I was doing before) I learned how to use - map(int, input().split(" ")) - which do the function int for every splitted input.

- How to declare a dict in just one line with - size_dict = {'P': size_P, 'M': size_M, 'G': size_G} -

- How to create a complete list direct from iterate something with the dictionary return with - titans = [size_dict[i] for i in titans_Order] -

- I became more used to 'list' 'append' 'pop' 'max' and 'len'
